# SMS Classification Notebook
 An RNN-based SMS Classification tool that gets rid of spam messages!

## RNNs for Text Classification

We will use a RNN based model to perform classification of SMS messages into Spam or not Spam (ham).

## How to run

1) Open the notebook in Colab Notebook.  
2) Import the dataset (smsspamcollection.zip, use the one given or use your own) and the GloVe word embeddings (glove.6B.txt.zip) to your google drive account.  
3) Run the Notebook.
